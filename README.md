# The Last Legacy of Honor

**The Last Legacy of Honor** is a text-based RPG game developed using a microservices architecture with Java 17. This project aims to deliver a prototype of the game as a console-based application. The prototype will include core gameplay mechanics, such as player management, quests, battles, inventory, and notifications, all powered by RESTful APIs.

## Key Objectives:
1. Develop a scalable backend using Java 17 microservices.
2. Implement core game functionalities with focus on modularity and performance.
3. Provide a foundation for future enhancements, including a graphical interface and multiplayer capabilities.

This game prototype will serve as a learning and practice project for junior developers, offering opportunities to contribute and gain experience in real-world software development.

**Current Features in Development:**
- Player registration and login system.
- Quest management and tracking.
- Turn-based battle mechanics.
- Inventory handling.
- Notification system for in-game events.
